## 🎯 **Answer: 3 Types of Nodes**

Your Neo4j database contains **3 different types of nodes**:

## 📋 **Node Types Summary**

| Node Type | Count | Properties | Description |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Document** | 140 | `code`, `name` | Largest collection - likely documents/files |
| **Training** | 41 | `code`, `name`, `summary` | Training records with summaries |
| **TrainingPlan** | 4 | `code`, `name` | Training plans/curricula |

## 📈 **Database Statistics**

- **Total Node Types:** 3
- **Total Nodes:** 185 (140 + 41 + 4)
- **Node Distribution:**
  - Documents: 75.7% (140/185)
  - Training: 22.2% (41/185)  
  - TrainingPlan: 2.2% (4/185)

## 🏗️ **Schema Overview**

### **Document Nodes**
- Properties: `code`, `name`
- Count: 140
- Likely represents: Documents, files, or documentation

### **Training Nodes**  
- Properties: `code`, `name`, `summary`
- Count: 41
- Likely represents: Training sessions, courses, or modules
- Additional property: `summary` (more detailed than others)

### **TrainingPlan Nodes**
- Properties: `code`, `name`
- Count: 4
- Likely represents: Training curricula, programs, or plans

## 🔗 **Domain Analysis**

Based on the node types, this appears to be a **Training/Education Management System** or **Quality Management System (QMS)** database with:

1. **Documents** - Policies, procedures, manuals
2. **Training** - Individual training sessions/modules  
3. **TrainingPlan** - Structured training programs

This aligns perfectly with your project name "QMSDocumentQueryApp"!

## 🎯 **Next Steps for Phase 1**

Now that we know your domain, we can:

1. ✅ **Node Types Identified** - 3 types (Document, Training, TrainingPlan)
2. ✅ **Schema Understood** - Properties and relationships
3. 🔄 **Next:** Explore relationships between these nodes
4. 🔄 **Next:** Create sample natural language queries for this domain

## 💡 **Sample Questions for Your LLM System**

With this schema, users could ask:
- "Show me all training plans"
- "Find documents related to safety training"  
- "How many training sessions are available?"
- "What training plans include document X?"

Perfect foundation for your Natural Language → Cypher query system!
